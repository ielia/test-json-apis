# DEPRECATED

# test-json-apis

Testing library that returns error permutations of JSONs to be sent to the API
under test.

This is only a first approach. So far it works with non-null values,
but does not deal with annotations, other than what the serializer can already
deal with.

See `AppTest` class for information about usage.
